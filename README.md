<h1 align="center">🧙‍♂️ Invisibility Cloak</h1>

Inspired by the magical world of Harry Potter, this project brings a piece of the wizarding universe into reality. In the books and movies, Harry Potter, created by J.K. Rowling, is a young wizard who embarks on thrilling adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Among his many magical artifacts is the legendary invisibility cloak, a rare and powerful item that allows its wearer to become completely invisible. This project recreates that experience using modern technology, blending fantasy and computer vision to deliver a real-time "invisibility" effect.

* Customizable Cloak Color: Replace any chosen color with the background.
* Dynamic Background Capture: Ensures the cloak blends perfectly with your surroundings.
